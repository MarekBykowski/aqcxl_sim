- User can scp software applications into QEMU guest OS from the port listed in
  Question b), `scp -P<port number> <username>@localhost`.

b. I tried running using the instructions in the README file. For the ssh port,
   I don’t see any message with “SSH…” in it. Could you please help to let me
   know how to determine the port for using ssh -pxx qemu@localhost?
- The line displaying the ssh port is not displayed in the log file, right after
  running the `run_qemu.pl -cxl1.1 -dbg -qc ~/qcow/$USER.img`
  "run_qemu.pl: SSH port is set to 2222" should be displayed as the line after.

c. Do I have to delete the content of run directory for every new run or the
   script handles the cleaning?
- For each run, the script overwrites the files generated under your current
  run directory.

d. How do I change the password for the account?
- Using the passwd command from Linux will be enough.
